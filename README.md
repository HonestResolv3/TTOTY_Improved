# TTOTY_Improved
A mod for Thirstiest Time of the Year (By Norboo) that fixes bugs seen with the original game

Some bugs fixed:
```
- You can shoot Fanta while you are in the attack sequence
- You can shoot Fanta while you are paused
- Lebron James will move forward even though he is stunned (Rarely happens, still looking into it)
```

Some things changed:
```
- Dialogue messages
- Volume of knocking at the start gets louder every 3 seconds until the 3rd to 4th iteration
```
